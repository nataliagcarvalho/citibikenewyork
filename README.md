# Goal

The project's goal is to do an exploratory analysis of the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike?project=data-sandbox-319716">Citi Bike New York Public Dataset</a> and to identify the following metrics:

- Daily use metrics:
  - Number of average trips each day;
  - Number of average used bikes each day;
  - Maximum, minium, average, standard deviation and percentis of trip duration.

- Historical metrics:
  - Total of trips (cumulative);
  - Growth in the number of daily trips over time;
  - Total trips by passengers, by gender and age.

- Passenger behavior (trips in one day, days of the week of higher use, trip duration and routes used), by user tipe:
  - Customer = user with 24 hours pass or 7 days pass;
  - Subscriber = annual subscription.
 
And based on this exploratory analysis, take insights, conclusions and recommendations.

# Exploratory Analysis, Conclusion and Recommendation

As it's a very big and heavy dataset, I've decided to do the dashboard and all the analysis directly in <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/aa7fc860-9d52-4da8-b2cf-0c0137b07d0d/page/p_ti02m34oyc">Google Data Studio</a>.
